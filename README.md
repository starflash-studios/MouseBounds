# MouseBounds
 Clamp your mouse to your screen! Or mirror it on it's axis; unity-style.

## Folder Structure?
 The folder structure in this GitHub project is quite unique, and may even seem random. This is due to most scripts in separate folders being almost entirely universal and modular. This means that you are free to use and modify these components for your other projects, such as DirectHotkey and TrayIcon (given you credit this project of course ;) ).
